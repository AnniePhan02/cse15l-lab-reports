# Annie and Bryan
## This is a virtual album that documents the memories of our relationship. Enjoy!

We first met in November 2021. Our mutual friends set us up. My friend told me to talk to him and vice versa. Personally, I felt that we instantly clicked. I remember talking to him all the time because we never ran out of things to say.

I would like to say that he is my best friend, butler, chaffeur, chef, maid, and personal atm in one person. He is the ultimate all-in-one deal. I `love` spending time with him.

How I feel about Bryan Yu:
He always knows how to make me feel like a princess. He notices the finer details because the small things add up. No matter how much I can be, he is always there to make me happy. Only downside is that he farts too much.

## Prelude
Annie's first impression of Bryan was that he does Whip-Its for fun with his friends. Amber invited her out to hangout at Bryan's house. First time up-close interaction.


On our first group outing, we went to La Jolla Shores to look at the seals. He was shy and didn't talk to Annie. She knew how he felt beforehand LOL.

## First Dates
Bryan sponetaneously asked Annie to go on a late night boba tea run with him at Tea Station. Straight up giggles and awkwardness the whole time. They talked for a wee bit after.

Next up, is their first dinner date - `Siamnara Thai Cuisine`. She didn't know Bryan that well at the time but she wanted to lick the spoon when they finished eating.
