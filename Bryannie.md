# Annie and Bryan
## This is a virtual album that documents the memories of our relationship. Enjoy!

We first met in November 2021. Our mutual friends set us up. My friend told me to talk to him and vice versa. Personally, I felt that we instantly clicked. I remember talking to him all the time because we never ran out of things to say.

I would like to say that he is my best friend, butler, chaffeur, chef, maid, and personal atm in one person. He is the ultimate all-in-one deal. I `love` spending time with him.

How I feel about Bryan Yu:
He always knows how to make me feel like a princess. He notices the finer details because the small things add up. No matter how much I can be, he is always there to make me happy. Only downside is that he farts too much.
