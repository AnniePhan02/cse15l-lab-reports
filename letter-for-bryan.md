# Dear Bryan Yu,

This is a letter expressing my deep love for you.

You have always shown through that you will be here for me no matter what. You are my one best friend and no one has ever known me better than you. You understand how I think and interpret the world around me. You accomodate all my needs.

You are my private chaffeur, michelin star chef, exotic maid, and lover all-in-1. (Buy 1 get 1 deal bundle). I love all that you do. You fit my needs and understand what I want in my life. You make me happy.

I love your support. Being a CS major at UCSD is academically rigorous and is quite stressful. You are able to walk me through my stress and anxiety surrounding midterms, finals, and PAs. You listen to my concerns and address them. I hope your support can help us both be successful in the future and rich af.

You are very funny too. My toe muncher. My grub goblin. My twinkie toes.

I love you, Bryan Yu.

With love,

Annie Phan
