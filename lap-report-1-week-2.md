# Lab 1 Tutorial
Hello, this is how you can remotely log into a course-specific account. I am a MAC user so here are my directions for MAC. 

## 1) Install VSCode on your computer
Click onto the link [VSCodelink](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the version of VSCode for your computer. I am a mac user so I downloaded the MacOS version.

Once you have installed it on your computer, your screen should look like this:

## 2) Remotely connect to your ieng6 course-specific account
Now, let's connect to your course specific account. Locate your account name by following this link: [AccountLookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Note that it will be something along the lines of cs15wi22**zz**@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Replace **zz** with your course-specific initials. 

Also, you will need to change your password in order to activate this account. It might take around 15 minutes for the password to activate before you can remotely log in.

Now, go back to VSCode and pull up the terminal by dragging it up from the bottom of the screen. 

Type in `ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (replace zz with your course-specific account initials)

Since it is likely that it is your first time connecting to this, you will see an output that asks “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”. Type “yes” and press enter. 

Now, it should ask for your password. Here is what your terminal should look like.
